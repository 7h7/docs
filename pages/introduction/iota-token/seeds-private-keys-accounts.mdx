## Seeds and Accounts

The starting point for everything is a **seed**.

To create an account with private keys and addresses you need
to have a secure seed. A seed consists of 81-trytes (or less,
which is not advised), and is your unique access key to your
account and thus your funds. The seed has to be securely stored.
A recommendation for securely generating a seed can be found here.

In IOTA, we provide you with 3 security levels to choose from. A security level determines the number of rounds for hashing, which means that a single seed can have 3 different accounts.

<Table>
  <Row>
    <BoldCell>Security Level</BoldCell>
    <Cell>Security</Cell>
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <BoldCell>1</BoldCell>
    <Cell>81-trits (low)</Cell>
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <BoldCell>2</BoldCell>
    <Cell>162-trits (medium)</Cell>
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <BoldCell>3</BoldCell>
    <Cell>243-trits (high)</Cell>
  </Row>
</Table>

Level 3 (243-trits security) is advised to be used by all
exchanges. The client libraries make it possible to easily
switch and choose from a security level.

## Private Keys and Addresses

Private keys are derived from a seeds key index. From that
private key you then generate an address. The key index starting
at 0, can be incremented to get a new private key, and thus address.

It is important to keep in mind that all security-sensitive functions
are implemented client side. What this means is that you can generate
private keys and addresses securely in the browser, or on an offline
computer. All libraries provide this functionality.

IOTA uses winternitz one-time signatures, as such you should ensure
that you know which private key (and which address) has already been
used in order to not reuse it.

Subsequently, **reusing private keys can lead to the loss of funds**.  
An attacker will be able to forge the signature after continuous key reuse.
As such, never reuse private keys and addresses! If you are waiting
for a transaction/bundle to confirm, always reattach it and never respend!

> NEVER REUSE ADDRESSES ${<br/>} Because IOTA uses Winternitz one-time signatures,
> you should **never** reuse an address after you have spent from it.
> Continuously reusing private keys gives a sophisticated attacker the ability
> to forge the signatures, thus being able to steal funds from the respective address.
