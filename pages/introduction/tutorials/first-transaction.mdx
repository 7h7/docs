This basic guide will show you how to setup your environment and send your first **0** value transaction on the IOTA Public Devnet. Setting up a transaction with value is essentially the same but requires a [seed](/introduction/iota-token/seeds-private-keys-accounts) with tokens in it.

### Requirements:

- Node.js 8+
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Code editor
- Terminal Access
- An Internet Connection

---

To start we need to create a working directory:

<TerminalInput>{`mkdir iota-example && cd iota-example`}</TerminalInput>

Once in our directory we can use Node Package Manager (NPM)
to fetch and install the required Node.js libraries for IOTA to the folder:

<TerminalInput>{`npm install @iota/core @iota/converter --save`}</TerminalInput>

This will result in a `package.json` file and a `node_modules` folder
being created in your directory. After this we will create a new file
called `index.js` in the current folder with the following contents:

<Code1 />

After saving the file you can run this code using this command:

<TerminalInput>{`node index.js`}</TerminalInput>

This should result in the following output:

<Image
src={`/static/docs/getting-started/first-response.png`}
width={710}
height={386}
caption="Output of our getNodeInfo call"
/>

Now that we've verified that the code is working and returning general
information about the node, we can create a transaction on the network.

At the bottom of the `index.js` file we will add a transaction to the
Devnet with the following message: `Hello World!`

To achieve this the following code needs to be appended:

```javascript
const address =
  'HELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDD'
const seed =
  'PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX'
const message = iota.utils.toTrytes('Hello World!')

const transfers = [
  {
    value: 0,
    address: address,
    message: message
  }
]

iota
  .prepareTransfers(seed, transfers)
  .then(trytes => iota.sendTrytes(trytes, 3, 9))
  .then(bundle => {
    console.log(bundle)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // catch any errors
  })
```

Lets break this code down:

**Trytes:**

```javascript
const address =
  'HELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDD'
const seed =
  'PUEOTSEITFEVEWCWBTSIZM9NKRGJEIMXTULBACGFRQK9IMGICLBKW9TTEVSDQMGWKBXPVCBMMCXWMNPDX'
```

We define `address` and `seed` here to be used in the `prepareTransfer` function. The `seed` here is random and contains no value.

_Note: Seeds and Address are both comprised of Trytes and are 81 characters in length._

**Message:**

```javascript
const message = Converter.asciiToTrytes('Hello World!')
```

This line create a constant that is the message `Hello World` and
encodes it to the Trytes format that the IOTA network accepts.

**Transfers:**

```javascript
const transfers = [
  {
    value: 0,
    address: address, // HELLOWORLDHELLOWORLDHELLO....WORLDD
    message: message
  }
]
```

This array lets you specify transfers you want to make from
your Seed. In this case we want a transaction with **Zero** value,
to our HELLOWORLD address with the message `Hello World` encoded in trytes.

**Transfer Function:**

```javascript
iota
  .prepareTransfers(seed, transfers)
  .then(trytes => iota.sendTrytes(trytes, (depth = 3), (mwm = 9)))
  .then(bundle => {
    console.log(bundle)
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // catch any errors
  })
```

These functions invoke the library to do a number of steps to construct a
transaction locally, via the `prepareTransfers` function, then send it too a Full Node, via the `sendTrytes` function, to be sent to other nodes on the network.

Lets take a second to figure out what the variables do:

<OutputTable>
<Row>
<BoldCell>seed</BoldCell>
<TypeCell>String</TypeCell>
<Cell>This is the 'wallet' you are sending from. With 0 value transactions we do not need to have
any tokens in the wallet. So this can be 81 random Trytes.</Cell>
</Row>
<Row>
<BoldCell>mwm</BoldCell>
<TypeCell>Number</TypeCell>
<Cell>This is the minimum weight magnitude (MWM) that specifies how mwm proof of work is required.
On the Devnet, anything less than 9 is not going to be accepted</Cell>
</Row>
<Row>
<BoldCell>depth</BoldCell>
<TypeCell>Number</TypeCell>
<Cell>This specifies the number of bundles you will walk back and confirm.</Cell>
</Row>
<Row>
<BoldCell>transfers</BoldCell>
<TypeCell>Array</TypeCell>
<Cell>This array contains the value, address and message of your desired transaction. You can specify multiple transactions to different addresses.</Cell>
</Row>
</OutputTable>

## Final Code

The resulting code should look like this:

<Code2 />

Now if you run this code, you should see the Node's information logged to
console but also you should see the transfer object you have just sent:

<Image
src={`/static/docs/getting-started/success.png`}
width={920}
height={604}

/>

Congratulations ðŸŽŠ. You've just sent your first IOTA transaction. Now, we just
need to go retrieve it. This will be covered in the next article.
