We have built a Testnet to provide a healthy network
topology and ensure successful operations. The network's
nodes are open to API calls and requests, but at present
we do not provide peering (TCP & UDP) to the nodes of the
test network.

Access to the Testnet is provided through the following endpoints:

## Nodes HTTPS API

This is a High Availability Proxy to provide load balancing
to the nodes that comprise the Testnet. This is accessible over
HTTPS on port 443.

<Code>https://nodes.testnet.iota.org:443</Code>

Check out the **Node** documentation: [here](https://iota.readme.io/reference#)

_note: IRI documentation will be transitioned to this platform in the coming days._

## Realtime Message Stream - Ã˜MQ

This provides access to the Zero Message Queue of the IRI
node. This provides the ability to subscribe to the Node in various ways.

<Code>https://zmq.testnet.iota.org:443</Code>

## Pow Box - Proof of Work service

This endpoint provides access to a means of delegating Proof of Work
to a third-party. This is useful for small devices or simulations.

<Code>https://powbox.testnet.iota.org</Code>
