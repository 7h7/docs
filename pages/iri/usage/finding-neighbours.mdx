In order to run IRI and sync with the network, you need to
have neighbors which want to pair with you. The easiest and
fastest way to get neighbors is through our <ExternalLink href="https://discord.gg/7Gu2mG5" key="">Discord</ExternalLink>, where you
can join the `#nodesharing` channel to find neighbors.

It should be noted that you have to share your own IP/URL and
port with your neighbors as well, because IOTA relies on
mutual tethering for the data exchange. If you need help
simply ask on Discord in the `#help` channel.
