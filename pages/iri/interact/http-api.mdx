The IOTA Java client makes it possible to interact with
your local node and request certain information or actions
to be taken. Once your node is successfully setup, you can
interface with it through port \`14265\` by passing along a JSON
object which contains a specified command; and upon
successful execution of the command, returns your requested
information.

The main priority of the API as well as IRI itself is
security. As such, anything that has to do with private keys
is done client side. For this we have provided several libraries
that take care of this, but you can implement this functionality
yourself as well.

For your convenience, we have added concrete examples on how
to use the API in Curl, Python and NodeJS.

> For the rest of this documentation it is assumed that you have
> the IOTA client running at port 14265 or a port of your choice,
> change your requests accordingly then.

## Make a Request

All API calls need to be sent to \`http://localhost:14265\` (if
you are using the standard port) via a POST HTTP request.
The data which will be sent is a JSON object which follows
the same standard schema of:

<Code>{`{"command": "yourCommandHere"}`}</Code>

Additional parameters are simply added as additional key-value
pairs. If the command is successfully executed, your requested
information is returned as either an object or a stringified
object (use json.parse or equivalent to turn it into an object).

When making a request, make sure that the HTTP library you're
using defines the Content-Length of the data to be sent. If
this is not done automatically, manually add it via a header
field e.g. `Content-Length: Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(command))`
