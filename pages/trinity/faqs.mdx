#### Can I make a mistake with Trinity Wallet?

Trinity is engineered to be as simple to use as possible. This means that as long as you keep your account password and seed backup secure, your funds are secure.

However as with any e-currency, you can still send funds to an incorrect address. Please ensure that the Send address is correct on the Send Confirmation screen. A transaction that is sent cannot be retracted or reimbursed.

#### Why is my balance incorrect?

Your account may be out of sync with the Tangle. To fix this, change
the node you are connected to, then perform a manual sync. If you
have not used your wallet on this device in a long time,
you may need to perform a Snapshot Transition. Manual Sync and Snapshot Transition
can be found in Account Management/Tools on desktop, and Advanced Settings on mobile.
Also note that future developments in IOTA will eliminate the need to perform snapshot transitions.

#### Why is my transaction not confirming?

Find your transaction in the History section (main page on Desktop,
History tab on Mobile) and click on it. Then hit the “Retry” button.
This will help to get your transaction confirmed. You can automate this
process by turning on “Auto-promotion” in Settings. Please note that
auto-promotion on Mobile is only available when the app is in the foreground.

#### What is a SeedVault?

A SeedVault is an encrypted file for storing your seed securely.
The seed is encrypted behind a password and cannot be accessed without
that password. This results in a very safe way to store your seed.

#### I can’t send my IOTA because Trinity stops me. Why is this?

This can be for a number of reasons:

- For security reasons IOTA addresses should only be used once for sending.
  If you have funds on an address that has already been spent from, Trinity
  stops you spending again from that address. This is done to protect your funds.
  Please get in touch with us on the #help channel in the official IOTA
  Discord for further help.

- If the address you are sending to has been used in the past (i.e. already spent from),
  Trinity will prevent you sending to that address to protect the funds. In this case,
  please request a fresh address from your recipient.

- If you are making multiple transactions, you may need to wait for your first
  transaction to be confirmed before making another transaction. Then you should
  be able to send your second transaction.

#### I have lost access to my device! How do I recover my wallet?

Don’t worry, nobody can access your seed or balance without your password.
You can access your funds by reinstalling Trinity on another device and using
your SeedVault file or other seed backup to retrieve your seed safely.

To restore your wallet, simply select "Yes" when the Wallet Setup
asks if you already have a seed. Then enter the seed or import your SeedVault file.
Ensure the checksum matches your backup checksum. After choosing a new password,
Trinity will automatically restore your account balance.

If you want to be extra careful, please transfer your funds to a new seed at this time.

#### Why doesn't Trinity support fingerprint authentication?

Trinity puts the security of your funds above all else. Current limitations in the Android OS
pose a tough question for developers. We have to choose between permitting users the
convenience of using fingerprints scanners, vs. the risk of offering a less secure wallet.
As always, IOTA leans toward security. We are constantly evaluating options to retain
maximum security and improve the user experience.
