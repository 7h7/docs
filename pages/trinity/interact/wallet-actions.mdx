At the moment Trinity **does not** support background processes.
Anything you do in the wallet – including logging in, sending transactions,
and refreshing your balance – require the wallet to be in the foreground.

If you navigate to another app while an
action is ongoing, that action will be **not** be completed.

> Leave Trinity open while it completes an action

Future builds of Trinity will enable background processes.
