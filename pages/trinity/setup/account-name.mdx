Trinity has the option to have multiple 'accounts' within
the app. This allows you to have multiple accounts
much like a banking app.

During setup, select a name for the account so you can identify it:

<Image
src={`/static/docs/trinity/accounts-setup.jpg`}
width={650}
height={290}
caption="Choosing account name on setup."
/>

> The standard name is “Main Account”

Each account represents a different **seed**. So whenever you create a
new account be sure to follow the correct backup procedures.

You can rename each account in the Settings tab. A descriptive account name helps you remember the purpose of the account.
